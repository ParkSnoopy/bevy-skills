# bevy-vfx — Non-hanabi VFX: CPU particles, flipbooks, vector shapes, trails, decals

> Referenced from `bevy-vfx/SKILL.md § Topics`.

## When NOT to use hanabi

`bevy_hanabi` is the right tool for GPU-computed fields of thousands of independent
particles. Reach for the alternatives below when:

- **Count < ~100 particles** — spawning individual `Sprite` entities and driving them
  with a Bevy system is simpler, debuggable, and zero dependency overhead.
- **WebGL2 target** — `bevy_hanabi 0.19.0` requires WebGPU. It will not compile or
  run on `wasm32` with the `webgl2` feature. Use sprite flipbooks or custom-material
  shaders instead.
- **Canned, identical-every-time FX** — hit-sparks, muzzle flashes, explosions where
  every instance plays the same frame sequence. A sprite-sheet flipbook is simpler and
  runs on any backend.
- **Stylized / geometric look** — rings, lightning bolts, SDF shapes. Use
  `bevy_vector_shapes` rather than fighting hanabi's shading model.

## CPU-particle pattern

For small bursts (smoke puffs, blood splatter, debris), spawn entities directly.
Cost: O(particle count) CPU, one draw call per particle (batching helps if all use the
same material and mesh).

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

#[derive(Component)]
struct Particle {
    velocity: Vec3,
    lifetime: Timer,
}

fn spawn_burst(mut commands: Commands, asset_server: Res<AssetServer>) {
    let image = asset_server.load("textures/spark.png");
    for i in 0..30_u32 {
        let angle = (i as f32 / 30.0) * std::f32::consts::TAU;
        commands.spawn((
            Sprite::from_image(image.clone()),
            Transform::from_xyz(0.0, 0.0, 0.0),
            Particle {
                velocity: Vec3::new(angle.cos(), angle.sin(), 0.0) * 3.0,
                lifetime: Timer::from_seconds(0.8, TimerMode::Once),
            },
        ));
    }
}

fn tick_particles(
    mut commands: Commands,
    time: Res<Time>,
    mut q: Query<(Entity, &mut Transform, &mut Particle)>,
) {
    for (entity, mut xf, mut p) in &mut q {
        p.lifetime.tick(time.delta());
        if p.lifetime.finished() {
            commands.entity(entity).despawn();
        } else {
            xf.translation += p.velocity * time.delta_secs();
            p.velocity *= 0.92; // drag
        }
    }
}
```

Fine up to a few hundred particles. Past that, draw-call overhead dominates — switch
to hanabi or collapse into a single `Mesh2d` with a custom material.

## Sprite-sheet flipbooks — `bevy_spritesheet_animation 7.0.1`

`bevy_spritesheet_animation` (supports `bevy = "0.19"`) drives `TextureAtlas` index
sequences from an animation library. Best fit: every instance plays the same frames
in order — explosions, hit-sparks, muzzle flashes.

```toml
[dependencies]
bevy = "0.19"
bevy_spritesheet_animation = "7.0.1"
```

Key types: `SpritesheetAnimationPlugin`, `AnimationLibrary`, `SpritesheetAnimation`,
`AnimationId`. Define clips once in `AnimationLibrary`, attach `SpritesheetAnimation`
to the `Sprite` + `TextureAtlas` entity, and let the plugin drive the atlas index.

What it does NOT do: individual particle physics. Every spawned entity plays the same
frame sequence — there is no per-instance velocity or simulation.

## Vector / SDF shapes — `bevy_vector_shapes 0.13.1`

`bevy_vector_shapes` (supports `bevy = "0.19"`) renders GPU-accelerated circles, lines,
arcs, and polygons with SDF anti-aliasing.

```toml
[dependencies]
bevy = "0.19"
bevy_vector_shapes = "0.13.1"
```

Key types: `Shape2dPlugin`, `ShapePainter`. Call `painter.circle(radius)`,
`painter.line(start, end)`, `painter.ngon(sides, radius)` in a system; the plugin
batches them into draw calls automatically.

Good for: stylized SFX — shockwave rings, lightning bolts, lock-on reticles, force
fields. The look is crisp and geometric rather than textured.

> Prefer `bevy_vector_shapes 0.13.1` for maintained Bevy 0.19 vector-shape support.

## Trails

For Bevy 0.19 trails, two viable approaches are:

- **`LineList` mesh history** — maintain a ring buffer of the trailing entity's recent
  world positions; rebuild a `LineList` or `TriangleStrip` `Mesh` each frame (or every
  N frames). Full control over width, UV scrolling, fading.
- **`ShapePainter` line strokes** — call `painter.line(prev, cur)` each frame from the
  history buffer. Simpler code; less control over width taper and UVs.

Both approaches are hand-rolled; choose based on how much visual polish the trail needs.

## Decals

For Bevy 0.19 decals, the hand-roll approach is:

1. Spawn a thin quad slightly offset from receiver geometry (or use a `DepthBiasState`).
2. Assign a custom `Material` with `AlphaMode::Blend` (or `Premultiplied`) and a
   decal texture.
3. For projected decals (arbitrary receiver geometry), add a projection matrix uniform
   to the material and clip in the fragment shader.

This is a known gap in the ecosystem. Complexity scales quickly for projected decals —
budget authoring time accordingly.
